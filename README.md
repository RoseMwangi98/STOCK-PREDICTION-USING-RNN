# STOCK-PREDICTION-USING-RNN
1.Defining the Question

We have a portfolio of 4 stocks namely: Apple, Facebook, Google and Tesla. We would like to build models that provide a forecast of the future share price. In addition, we build a model that predicts the future price of a reference index(S&P 500) using Long Short Term Memory (LTSM) a subset of Neural Networks.

2.Metric for Success

The best performing model with the least and most sensible Root Mean Square Error and the highest Accuracy Score.

3.The Context

Stock market price prediction is a fundamental exercise in Finance, Valuation, Accounting et al. Share price forecasting is one of the avenues for creating a semblance of clarity in a rather risky and unceratin world of finance enabling investment decisions. To do this, the market relies on historical data. For our purposes, we leverage publicly available data over a 5year period to build a predictive model.
